## Welcome to GitHub Pages

[This](https://shanewang09.github.io/web-development-course/) is the webpage where everything resides. Remember to append the folder to the site to access the webpages in the other folders. 

Use 
```
browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"
```
in the terminal/command prompt/powershell to get browser sync running. 

Use 
```
browser-sync start --server --directory --files "**/*"
```
for recursive updates. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/shanewang09/web-development-course/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shanewang09/web-development-course/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
